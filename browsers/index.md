# Current Browser/Rendering Engine Information

You can view data across different browsers at [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid). I'll maintain a list of more detailed information here.

## Microsoft Edge

On launch Edge shipped with the IE11 Grid implementation. In September 2015 Microsoft indicated that updating Grid to the current spec is [on the backlog with a priority of High](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6514853-update-css-grid).

## Internet Explorer 10 and 11

The original Grid implementation was part of IE10, also in IE11. This implementation is now quite different to the current spec and other implementations.

## Blink Rendering Engine (Chrome, Opera)

[Blink Meta Bug](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=79180)

The most complete implementation of Grid is in Blink. This implementation has been carried out by Igalia, sponsored by Bloomberg. You can [read about the implementation work in this post from Igalia](http://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2015/01/08/css-grid-layout-2014-recap-implementation-status/).

At the present time you need to enable the Experimental Web Platform Features Flag in Chrome or Opera. 

## Webkit 

[Webkit Meta Bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60731)

Grid is available, with a -webkit prefix in [Webkit Nightly builds](http://nightly.webkit.org/). This implementation is also by Igalia but lags slightly behind the Chrome one.

Something being in Webkit does not automatically mean it will be part of Safari. We live in hope.

## Gecko Rendering Engine (Firefox)

[Gecko Meta Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616605)

Grid is currently being implemented in Gecko.
