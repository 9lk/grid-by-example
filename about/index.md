## About me

I'm Rachel Andrew - a web developer, writer and speaker based in the UK. When I'm not messing about with CSS I'm one half of the company behind the CMS [Perch](http://grabaperch.com). I've been researching Grid Layout since the early IE10 implementation. I really like it, and want other people to like it too. A lot of the research in these examples was originally for my book [CSS3 Layout Modules, 2nd edition](http://rachelandrew.co.uk/books/css3-layout-modules/) and my presentation on [CSS Grid Layout](http://rachelandrew.co.uk/presentations/css-grid).
