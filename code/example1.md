description_md: "To define a Grid use `display:grid` or `display:inline-grid` on the parent element. You can then create a grid using the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties.

I am using the `grid-gap` property to create a gap between my columns and rows of `10px`. This property is a shorthand for `grid-column-gap` and `grid-row-gap` so you can set these values individually.

All direct children of the parent now become grid items and the auto-placement algorithm lays them out, one in each grid cell. Creating extra rows as needed.""
