Playing with a layout as can be seen on the [Tuts+ website](http://tutsplus.com/) to create a version that has more tolerance for additional content or additional content boxes.

Uses the `minmax()` function when creating rows to achieve this. See a video explaining some key features here: [https://youtu.be/paBou8Fy25k](https://youtu.be/paBou8Fy25k)
