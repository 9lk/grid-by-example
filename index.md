# Grid by Example <small>simple usage examples for the CSS3 Grid Layout Module</small>

I have been writing and speaking about the CSS Grid Layout Module for some time now. In order to learn how Grid works I've put together lots of small examples, and I am publishing them here as a resource for anyone else interested in this emerging specification.

## Grid Examples

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">
<div><a href="/examples/#example5">Line based placement spanning cells</a></div>
<img src="/examples/images/example5.png" alt="Line based placement spanning cells" />
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<div><a href="/examples/#example8">Line based placement named lines with span</a></div>
<img src="/examples/images/example8.png" alt="Line based placement named lines with span" />
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<div><a href="/examples/#example19">Grid auto flow with a positioned element</a></div>
<img src="/examples/images/example19.png" alt="Line based placement spanning cells" />
</div>
</div>

## Examples of layout with Grid

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">
<div><a href="/examples/code/layout11.html">Two column responsive layout with footer</a></div>
<img src="/examples/images/layout-twocol.png" alt="Two column responsive layout with footer" />
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<div><a href="/examples/code/layout12.html">Skeleton 12 column grid experiments</a></div>
<img src="/examples/images/layout12.png" alt="Skeleton 12 column grid experiments" />
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<div><a href="/examples/code/layout8.html">Auto placement example</a></div>
<img src="/examples/images/layout8.png" alt="Auto placement" />
</div>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info"><a href="/examples/page-layout">Explore all of the layouts</a></div>


If you spot any problems, have an enhancement suggestion or would like to see a certain aspect of the module explained then feel free to either submit a pull request or just drop me a line on [me@rachelandrew.co.uk](mailto:me@rachelandrew.co.uk).

## Latest Grid News

Mozilla have posted an [Intent to Implement CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mozilla.devel.platform/12343).

The [Editor's Draft of Grid published 20th December 2014](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-grid/) has made a few changes, one of which I'm very happy about as it solves an issue I had with some of my experiments. You can read all of the [changes to the spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-grid/#changes). I am particularly interested in the `auto` keyword for repeating grid tracks, as it will enable a track list to be defined, then that pattern repeated as often as is required by the content.

The `auto` keyword is not as yet implemented in Chrome. I have added an example which I believe is the correct usage - [example 20](/examples/#example20).

[There is an excellent blog post](http://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2014/12/30/css-grid-layout-2014-recap-specification-evolution/) from Manuel Rego Casasnovas, who works at Igalia and is involved in implementing Grid in Chrome and Blink. Read how the spec has evolved over 2014. 

[A second post](http://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2015/01/08/css-grid-layout-2014-recap-implementation-status/) from Manuel describes the current browser implementation status.

In [Box Alignment and Grid Layout II](http://blogs.igalia.com/jfernandez/2015/01/12/box-alignment-and-grid-layout-ii/) Javier Fern√°ndez writes about the box alignment implementation. THis work meant I needed to redo many of the screenshots in my examples as `stretch` is now implemented.

	<h3>CSS3 Layout Modules, 2nd Edition</h3>
	<p>A lot of the examples here were my test examples as I researched Grid for my latest book - CSS3 Layout Modules, 2nd edition. If you are interested in modern layout for the web, <a href="http://rachelandrew.co.uk/books/css3-layout-modules/">take a look at the book</a>.</p>
