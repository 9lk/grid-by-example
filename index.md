# CSS Grid Layout

The CSS Grid Layout specification is one of a few new specifications that are redefining how we approach layout for the web. Alongside Flexbox and the Box Alignment Module it will become part of a modern layout system for websites and web applications.

This site is growing collection of [examples](/examples) and [video](/video), with the aim of helping people understand how Grid Layout works.

<div class="box info">
	<p>Grid is starting to ship in browsers. If your browser doesn't have support you may need to enable a flag. <a href="/browsers">Read more about browser support for Grid</a>.</p>
</div>
