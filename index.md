# CSS Grid Layout

The CSS Grid Layout specification is one of a few new specifications that are redefining how we approach layout for the web. Alongside Flexbox and the Box Alignment Module it will become part of a modern layout system for websites and web applications.

This site is growing collection of examples, with the aim of helping people understand how Grid Layout works.

<div class="box info">
	<p>To view any of the examples in this site you need to enable CSS Grid Layout in your browser, or use a "Nightly" version of a browser that has Grid available. <a href="/browsers">Read more about browser support for Grid</a>.</p>

## About this site

These examples have been created by Rachel Andrew. I have been writing and speaking about the specification over the last few years.

If you spot any problems, have an enhancement suggestion or would like to see a certain aspect of the module explained then feel free to either submit a pull request or just drop me a line on [me@rachelandrew.co.uk](mailto:me@rachelandrew.co.uk). I'm also on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/rachelandrew">rachelandrew</a>.

**If you use these examples in your blog post, presentation or article then I'd appreciate a link back to this site.**

## Latest Grid News {#news}

The CSS Working Group have posted [asking for community feedback](http://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/2015/08/10/css-grid-pls-review/) on the CSS Grid Layout module before the Level 1 specification goes to Candidate Recommendation later this year.

[There is an excellent blog post](http://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2014/12/30/css-grid-layout-2014-recap-specification-evolution/) from Manuel Rego Casasnovas, who works at Igalia and is involved in implementing Grid in Chrome and Blink. Read how the spec has evolved over 2014.

[A second post](http://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2015/01/08/css-grid-layout-2014-recap-implementation-status/) from Manuel describes the current browser implementation status.

In [Box Alignment and Grid Layout II](http://blogs.igalia.com/jfernandez/2015/01/12/box-alignment-and-grid-layout-ii/) Javier Fern√°ndez writes about the box alignment implementation. This work meant I needed to redo many of the screenshots in my examples as `stretch` is now implemented.
