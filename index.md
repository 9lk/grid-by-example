# Grid by Example <small>simple usage examples for the CSS3 Grid Layout Module</small>

I have been writing and speaking about the CSS Grid Layout Module for some time now. In order to learn how Grid works I've put together lots of small examples, and I am publishing them here as a resource for anyone else interested in this emerging specification. 

I wanted to try and demonstrate Grid in a way that broke down the spec into smaller chunks, rather than large examples that show lots of different aspects of the specification at once. I have also posted some of the [examples I use in my presentation](examples/page-layout/), as these are simple layouts than show a few of the properties discussed in the examples at once.

If you spot any problems, have an enhancement suggestion or would like to see a certain aspect of the module explained then feel free to either submit a pull request or just drop me a line on [me@rachelandrew.co.uk](mailto:me@rachelandrew.co.uk). I'm also on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/rachelandrew">rachelandrew</a>.

In addition to my examples I have linked to other [resources and examples](/resources) and will try and keep this listing up to date. However I would welcome any additions.

## Latest Grid News

The [Editors Draft of Grid published 20th December 2014](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-grid/) has made a few changes, one of which I'm very happy about as it solves an issue I had with some of my experiments. You can read all of the [changes to the spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-grid/#changes). I am particularly interested in the `auto` keyword for repeating grid tracks, as it will enable a track list to be defined, then that pattern repeated as often as is required by the content.

The `auto` keyword is not as yet implemented in Chrome. I have added an example which I believe is the correct usage - [example 20](/examples/#example20).

[There is an excellent blog post](http://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2014/12/30/css-grid-layout-2014-recap-specification-evolution/) from Manuel Rego Casasnovas, who works at Igalia and is involved in implementing Grid in Chrome and Blink. Read how the spec has evolved over 2014.

	<p>A lot of the examples here were my test examples as I researched Grid for my latest book - CSS3 Layout Modules, 2nd edition. If you are interested in modern layout for the web, <a href="http://rachelandrew.co.uk/books/css3-layout-modules/">take a look at the book</a>.</p>
