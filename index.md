# CSS Grid Layout

The CSS Grid Layout specification is one of a few new specifications that are redefining how we approach layout for the web. Alongside Flexbox and the Box Alignment Module it will become part of a modern layout system for websites and web applications.

This site is growing collection of examples, with the aim of helping people understand how Grid Layout works.
