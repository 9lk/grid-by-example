I've not been very good at updating with bits of news since Grid shipped in browsers, however to complete the picture of browsers shipping Grid layout in 2017, Edge will ship their release to the public with the Windows update on October 17th, 2017.

I was also featured in [this video made by Microsoft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9uaT9dggZE&feature=youtu.be) to talk about some of the history of the specification.
