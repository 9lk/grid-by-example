The CSS Grid specification introduced a new unit for CSS. This is the `fr` unit and if you already use flexbox you'll see it behaves in a similar way to how `flex-grow` behaves when you set `flex-basis` to `0`.

The spec describes the `fr` unit as,

> "A flexible length or <flex> is a dimension with the fr unit, which represents a fraction of the free space in the grid container."

In this video from my [video series](/video), find out how to use the `fr` unit.
