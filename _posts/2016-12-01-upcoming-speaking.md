It has been quite a year for conferences! I have one more event this year, where I'll be talking about layout including Grid Layout, [ConFoo](https://confoo.ca/en/yvr2016) in Vancouver.

2017 is starting to take shape. I will be at all of the below events, speaking about Grid and layout. I've also got my first open workshop booked in at Smashing Conference in San Francisco.

- [ConFoo](https://confoo.ca/en/yvr2016), Vancouver, Canada
- [An Event Apart Seattle](https://aneventapart.com/event/seattle-2017), USA
- [Smashing Conference](https://smashingconf.com/), San Francisco, USA - talk and full-day workshop
- [Frontend United](http://frontendunited.org/), Athens, Greece
- [An Event Apart Boston](https://aneventapart.com/event/boston-2017), USA

Over at rachelandrew.co.uk is my main [listing of past and upcoming speaking engagements](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/speaking). You can also find details of how to [ask me to come and speak at your event](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/about/speaking) or to your in-house team. I tend to get booked up pretty quickly so the more notice the better! However do ask, especially if it looks as if I might be near your location already.
