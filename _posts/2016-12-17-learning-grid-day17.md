If you have been following along so far, then you might be thinking that it would be very handy to have support for inspecting and working with Grid Layout in browser DevTools. The nice folk over at Firefox thought the same thing. So if you are using Firefox Nightly or Developer Edition you can use the Grid Highlighter.

Here is [an article on the Mozilla Hacks Blog about the Grid Highlighter](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/12/css-grid-and-grid-highlighter-now-in-firefox-developer-edition/) and I recorded a short video to demonstrate it, which you can see below.

### What is this?

I'm sharing some tips to help you learn Grid Layout from the 1st of December until Christmas. Edited highlights from the things on this site and that I've posted elsewhere. **Follow along!**
