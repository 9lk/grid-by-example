One of the nice things about flexbox is the ability to get the browser to lay out as many things as will fit into a container giving them all an equal flexible width. We can do the same with grid by using the `auto-fill` or `auto-fit` keywords along with repeat notation.

In this video from my [video series](/video), I demonstrate auto-fill and auto-fit, explaining the difference betwen the two.
