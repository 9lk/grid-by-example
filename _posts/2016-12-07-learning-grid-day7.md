If you create a grid on an element all the child elements immediately become grid items, and will lay themselves out on your defined grid according to the auto-placemnt rules.

By default items will lay out one into each cell of the grid, howver you can also cause items to span multiple tracks and mix auto-placed items with positioned items.

In this video I take a look at how these auto-placement rules work. You can [find the demo shown in this video on CodePen](http://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/LRWPNp).
