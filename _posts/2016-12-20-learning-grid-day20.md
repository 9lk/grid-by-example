If grid items are being placed by auto-placement then they will be placed into empty cells on the grid, and not overlap each other. However you can position grid items into the same grid cells or allow them to overlap. Overlapping items can be controlled in terms of their stacking order using `z-index`.

I demonstrate in this video from my video tutorial [series](/video).
