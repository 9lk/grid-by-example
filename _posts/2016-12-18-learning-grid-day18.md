At All Things Open in Raleigh I gave a couple of presentations. Here is a video of my Grid Layout talk. The slides are a bit difficult to see in the video but you can [find them on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/rachelandrew/css-grid-layout-all-things-open).

Also, [all of the code examples shown in that talk can be found on CodePen](http://codepen.io/collection/DEPOzv/).

### What is this?

I'm sharing some tips to help you learn Grid Layout from the 1st of December until Christmas. Edited highlights from the things on this site and that I've posted elsewhere. **Follow along!**

If you find this style of learning useful then you might enjoy my online [CSS Layout Workshop](https://thecssworkshop.com/). I'm also available for in-house training, workshops and consultancy or [conference speaking](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/speaking).
