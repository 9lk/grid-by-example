We should see Grid support out from behind flags in Firefox and Chrome by March next year. You can keep track of browser updates and news on my [browsers page](/browsers). However, we will still have old browsers to consider and new browsers that don't yet support the new specification.

CSS has come up with a solution for us in Feature Queries. If you have ever used Modernizr you will be familiar with the concept of detecting support for a feature and then writing CSS only if the feature is supported, Feature Queries are a native CSS way of doing that.

Take a look at this in my video, which is part of my [CSS Grid video tutorial series](/video). You can also [read more about Feature Queries in this article by Jen Simmons](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/using-feature-queries-in-css/).
