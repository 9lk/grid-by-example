### What is this?

I'm sharing some tips to help you learn Grid Layout from the 1st of December until Christmas. Edited highlights from the things on this site and that I've posted elsewhere. **Follow along!**

If you find this style of learning useful then you might enjoy my online [CSS Layout Workshop](https://thecssworkshop.com/). I'm also available for in-house training, workshops and consultancy or [conference speaking](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/speaking).
