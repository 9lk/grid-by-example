Yesterday we took a look at aligning the grid items. You can also align the tracks of the grid - assuming that you have a grid container that is larger in one or both dimensions than the size of the tracks.

Using alignment in this way can cause unexpected results. For example, if you use the `space-between` or `space-around` values, any `grid-gap` you have set is going to get larger as the tracks space out. Once you understand the behaviour however, it's just another way of controlling your grid.

I demonstrate how aligning grid tracks work in this video from my [video tutorial series](/video).
