CSS Grid Layout really is coming to our browsers in 2017. In the last few weeks both Chrome and Firefox have posted their "intent to ship" the specification, un-prefixed and so we should see Grid out from behind browser flags by the end of the first quarter of 2017. Exciting stuff!

If you've been holding off learning the spec, now is a really great time to get started. To help, I have a whole heap of videos, example code and tutorials on this site and elsewhere. In the spirit of the "Advent Calendar" concept, I'm going to highlight something here every day running up to Christmas.

## Defining a grid - video

This is the first video in my [video series](/video) on this site. In it I show you how to define a grid on a parent element.

I'm sharing some tips to help you learn Grid Layout from the 1st of December until Christmas. Edited highlights from the things on this site and that I've posted elsewhere. **Follow along!**

If you find this style of learning useful then you might enjoy my online [CSS Layout Workshop](https://thecssworkshop.com/). I'm also available for in-house training, workshops and consultancy or [conference speaking](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/speaking).
